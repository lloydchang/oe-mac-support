prerequisites for building webos on a macintosh

Basically, this is a bunch of shell script which, when run, will build
and install the necessary prerequisites.

go.sh is a shell script that calls the others in turn.  Basically,
they unpack the source, build it, and install it, in classic gnu form.


TODO:

These things should produce MacOsX packages instead, perhaps even with
a dmg file.
